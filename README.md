vertical-rhythm
===============

Vertical Rhythm extension for Chrome

Just a small extension that adds a background-image ruler, so is
easier to controll vertical rhythm around text

Note: for a great explanation about vertical rhythm you can have a look
at the great [typecast blog post](http://bit.ly/S6UzuX "Typecast post about vertical rhythm")
